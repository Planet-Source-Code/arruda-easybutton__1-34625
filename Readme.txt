This code basically display three pictures
in certain order.  

I named this order like "MouseOut" when the
mouse is out of button, "MouseOver" when is
over button and "MouseDown" when mouse button
is pressed.   

To make a button is very easy. It's only you
draw a picture (See the sample in Form5.frm).   

About masks: In the picture must have a mask,
where is defined the clickable area.  

For better performance, it is a good idea to
compile the UserControl like OCX.

It's all.

I'm sending some examples of images too, in
separate zip.  

	Enjoy
